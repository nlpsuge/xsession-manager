# [xsession-manager](https://github.com/nlpsuge/xsession-manager)

Python-based command line tool to save and restore sessions for X11 desktops like Gnome, 
and other features to maintain sessions. The project is currently in an early stage of development.

This project was written in ```Bash``` originally. But now I'm completely rewriting it in ```Python```
which obviously makes it way more flexible, extensible.

This project relies on [wmctrl](http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/), which is why you have to install it beforehand.

## Install
### Install dependencies
+ Fedora 33
```Bash
dnf install python3-devel python3-tkinter wmctrl
```
### Install [xsession-manager](https://pypi.org/project/xsession-manager) via PyPi
```Bash
pip3 install xsession-manager
```
### Install xsession-manager via source code
```Bash
cd the_root_of_source_code
python3 setup.py install
```
## Common usage
+ Save running windows as a X session
```Bash
xsm -s
```
Note: It will save some window states, which include Always on Top and Always on Visible Workspace. These saved states will be used when executing `xsm -r` or `xsm -ma`.
+ Close running windows except those apps with mutiple windows. It's better to leave them to the user to close by hand, some apps like JetBrain's IDEs may have their own session.
```Bash
xsm -c
```
+ Close running windows include those apps with mutiple windows.
```Bash
xsm -c -im
```
+ Restore the saved X session
```Bash
xsm -r
```
+ Move running windows to their Workspaces according to the saved X session
```Bash
xsm -ma
```
+ List saved X sessions
```Bash
xsm -l
```
+ View the details of a saved X sessions
```Bash
xsm -t xsession-default
```


## Usage:

```
usage: xsm [-h] [-s [SAVE]] [-c [CLOSE_ALL ...]] [-im] [-r [RESTORE]] [-ri RESTORING_INTERVAL] [-pr [PR]] [-l] [-t DETAIL]
           [-x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [-i INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]] [-ma [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s [SAVE], --save [SAVE]
                        Save the current session. Save to the default session if not specified a session name.
  -c [CLOSE_ALL ...], --close-all [CLOSE_ALL ...]
                        Close the windows gracefully. Close all windows if only -c/--close-all is present. You can specify
                        arguments to specify which windows should be closed, that is <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or
                        <title_name> exactly the same as -x.
  -im, --including-apps-with-multiple-windows
                        Close the windows gracefully including apps with multiple windows
  -r [RESTORE], --restore [RESTORE]
                        Restore a session gracefully. Restore the default session if not specified a session name.
  -ri RESTORING_INTERVAL, --restoring-interval RESTORING_INTERVAL
                        Specify the interval between restoring applications, in seconds. The default is 2 seconds.
  -pr [PR]              Pop up a dialog to ask user whether to restore a X session.
  -l, --list            List the sessions.
  -t DETAIL, --detail DETAIL
                        Check out the details of a session.
  -x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...], --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                        Exclude apps from the operation according to <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or <title_name>. Require
                        at least one value
  -i INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...], --include INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]
                        Include apps from the operation according to <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or <title_name>. Require
                        at least one value
  -ma [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY], --move-automatically [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY]
                        Auto move windows to specified workspaces according to a saved session. The default session is
                        `xsession-default`

```

## If you want to restore the previous X session automatically after login
Here is a solution. If you are using Fedora, create a file named ```auto-restore-working-state.desktop``` and the ```Exec``` should be:
```bash
xsm -pr
```
Then put this file into ```~/.config/autostart```.

For example:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Auto Restore saved X Windows
Comment=
Icon=
Exec=xsm -pr
Terminal=false
Type=Application
X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=20
```

***NOTE: You can also use ```xsession-manager``` instead of ```xsm```.***
